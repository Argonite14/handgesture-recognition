# handgesture-recognition
**Project Overview**
The Hand Gesture Recognition System is an innovative computer vision project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the OpenCV library to interpret and classify hand gestures in real-time. This system enables human-computer interaction through intuitive hand movements, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including sign language recognition, gaming, and remote control.

**Key Features**
Real-time Gesture Recognition: The system can identify and classify hand gestures in real-time, allowing for seamless and immediate interaction.

User-Friendly Interface: With its user-friendly interface, users can easily teach the system new gestures and customize actions associated with them.

Multi-Class Classification: It can recognize a variety of hand gestures, making it versatile for different applications. For example, it can distinguish between gestures for letters in sign language, basic navigation commands, or game controls.

CNN-Based Model: The core of the system is a deep learning CNN model that has been trained on a diverse dataset of hand gestures. This ensures accurate and reliable recognition.

OpenCV Integration: Utilizing the OpenCV library ensures efficient image processing, feature extraction, and model integration, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Customizable Actions: Users have the flexibility to map recognized gestures to specific actions, making the system adaptable to various use cases.

**How It Works**
Hand Detection: The system uses OpenCV to detect and isolate the hand from the background in real-time video frames.

Gesture Recognition: The isolated hand is fed into a pre-trained CNN model. This model analyzes the hand's position, shape, and movement to recognize the gesture being made.

Action Execution: Once a gesture is recognized, the system can trigger a predefined action associated with that gesture. For example, if the user forms the letter 'A' in sign language, the system can interpret this as a command to open an application or perform a specific function.

User Customization: Users can teach the system new gestures and customize the associated actions through an intuitive interface.

**Use Cases**
* Sign Language Translation: The system can be used to convert sign language gestures into text or speech, promoting communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired.

* Gesture-Based Gaming: Gamers can control characters and actions in games using intuitive hand gestures, providing a more immersive gaming experience.

* Remote Control: Use hand gestures to control smart devices, such as TVs or home automation systems, eliminating the need for physical remote controls.

* Interactive Presentations: Presenters can use hand gestures to navigate slides or control multimedia elements during presentations.

* Human-Robot Interaction: In robotics, the system can be employed to enable natural and intuitive communication between humans and robots.

The Hand Gesture Recognition System using CNN and OpenCV opens up exciting possibilities for human-computer interaction and accessibility. Its ability to recognize a wide range of gestures in real-time, combined with user customization, makes it a versatile tool for various applications across industries. Whether it's enhancing communication for the hearing-impaired or adding a new dimension to gaming and entertainment, this system brings gesture recognition technology to the forefront of innovation.







# Requirements


Requirements:
- Python: You need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: Python Downloads.

- Python Libraries: You will need several Python libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, cvzone, Pillow (PIL), and NumPy. You can install them using pip, Python's package manager. Open your terminal/command prompt and run:


```pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python-headless pillow numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn```

If you encounter any issues while installing these libraries, you might need to install additional dependencies based on your operating system.

- Pre-trained Model: You need a pre-trained model file (in this case, 'my_model.h5') for hand gesture recognition. Make sure to have this model file ready and specify its correct path in the code. This file can be optained from training.ipynb
- Training Data: You need a training dataset of hand gesture images organized into classes. Based on your code, it seems that you have organized the training data in the following directory structure:
basedata/train (with subdirectories for each class)
- Testing Data: Similarly, you need a testing dataset of hand gesture images for evaluation.


basedata/test

Instructions to Implement:
Code Setup:

Copy and paste the provided code into a Python script file (e.g., gesture_recognition.py).

Place the pre-trained model file ('my_model.h5') in the same directory as your Python script or specify the correct path to the model in your code.

Running the Code:

Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python script and model file.

Run the code using the following command:

```python gesture_recognition.py```

The script should open your computer's webcam and start recognizing hand gestures in real-time. The recognized gestures will be displayed on the video feed, and the script will terminate when a certain number of "PALM" gestures are detected or when you press the 'q' key.

Customization:

You can customize the code further based on your specific requirements. For example, you can adjust the gesture recognition thresholds, modify the recognized gestures, or integrate additional actions based on the recognized gestures.
Exiting the Application:

To exit the application, simply press the 'q' key in the terminal where the code is running.
Remember that this code serves as a basic example of hand gesture recognition and may require further customization and fine-tuning to meet your specific needs. Additionally, ensure that your camera is properly connected and accessible to the script when you run it.
